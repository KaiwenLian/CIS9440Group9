# Overview

Companies need to take into account different sets of variables when deciding on a salary range for their job listings. Amongst those variables are: location, type of job, number of years of experience a candidate has, average living expenses and etc. The following project takes into account the following sources:

- census
- MIT living wages
- levels FYI
- minimum wages per state
- DMA

producing a dimensional modeling, breaking down these sources into a data warehouse via Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and performing an analysis breaking down the top coefficents for predicting a 95% confidence interval on the salary range.
